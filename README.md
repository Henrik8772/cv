This is a school asignment

We were tasked with making a resume website for a fiktional character.

My name is Henrik I am a student at NTI Gymnasium, this is my second year in TE24.

I made a resume for Sherma a character from a game called Hollowknight Silksong. 

My thought process through out this asignment was to make the website look as good as possible which I learned pretty early was a stupid starting point since I didn't even have the text writen in the resume.

I struggled a lot with making the website fit the screen size of devices but I believe I have gotten it down to work for every device.

This is one of the errors the validation found:

Error: Element ul not allowed as child of element span in this context. (Suppressing further errors from this subtree.)

From line 49, column 25; to line 49, column 41

          <ul class="info">↩     

Contexts in which element ul may be used:
Where flow content is expected.
Content model for element span:
Phrasing content.

I have fixed the error
